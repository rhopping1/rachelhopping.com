        <h2>Traveling with Autism: More Work than Fun?</h2>
        <img src="images/traveling.png" width="579" height="380" alt="traveling on Easter">
        <h3>March 28, 2016 </h3>
        <p>Today is Easter.  I am willingly hanging out with our oldest son, Gavin while my husband takes a road trip with our other three children to meet his family for Easter brunch.</p> 
        <p>We are a family of six and our oldest child has autism.  My husband and I always have the same debate where we weigh the fun/ work/ behavior ratio when it comes to traveling any distance. </p>
        <p>Along with this time of year is spring break.  I tend to take a Facebook vacation this week as I can’t bear to see the pictures of families flying to warm, sunny destinations.  It is not that I don’t desperately want to take a break from cold, dreary Wisconsin weather, it is more so that we don’t want to be the family where the commercial airliner has to make an emergency landing due to the child with autism absolutely freaking out on the flight.  Will Gavin freak out in an airplane?  We don’t actually know, but we have yet mustarded up enough courage to find out.</p>
        <p>This year we were the closest we have been to giving it a try, but instead we relented and decided to drive to Chicago.  I started the process of planning and booking our hotel; and after almost an hour on the phone with the hotel, I think we are set.  Why an hour to book a reservation?  I had to make sure that everything will be in place for Gavin to give us the greatest probability that this trip will be a success for all involved.</p>
        <p><span style="font-style:italic">Will the room have a refrigerator and a microwave?</span> Gavin’s special diet. </p>
        <p><span style="font-style:italic">Will there be a place to wash Gavin’s food dishes?</span> Gets kind of gross to brush teeth with food stuck in the drain. </p>
        <p><span style="font-style:italic">Will there be a pool?  How deep is it?</span> Gavin loves to “swim” as long as he can touch the bottom.</p>
        <p><span style="font-style:italic">Will there be parking for 2 cars?</span> We learned the hard way that if one child decompensates (mostly Gavin), that instead of frantically packing up the whole show, either my husband or I will leave with Gavin.</p>
        <p><span style="font-style:italic">Will people look at us weird when we bring in our small helium tank?</span> Helium balloons are Gavin’s “thing” now and work great when all else fails.</p>
        <p>We also need to consider what we are going to do when we are there.  All activities are decided upon with Gavin in mind.  This time we decided to make the planetarium a place we are going to visit.  Oddly, we most likely would not bring Gavin to the planetarium in our town, so why are we deciding to bring him to the one in Chicago? Denial? Hope? I am just not sure.</p>
        <p>But I do know at some point we have to start allowing our other children to have certain experiences at the risk of Gavin’s behavior.  When Gavin’s siblings were a lot younger, it wasn’t that big of a deal.  Now that they are getting older, we don’t feel we can any longer deny them because of their older brother.  While we do our best to create a “normal” life for them, it just isn’t when there is a sibling with special needs.  They all willingly sacrifice in some way everyday because of Gavin.</p>
        <p>While we are planning our short visit to Chicago, the reality is that our definition of a family vacation is starting to look much different than everyone else’s. In the end, what we find that works best is for myself or my husband to stay back with Gavin while the other one takes the 3 kids somewhere.</p>
        <p>Instead of my husband being at Disney to see the joy in my children’s faces, he instead has to experience this thru pictures I text and excited phone calls at the end of the day.</p>
        <p>Instead of Gavin and I enjoying Easter brunch with our extended family, we stayed back knowing Gavin’s time of sitting at a table is limited.</p>
        <p>While I would love nothing more that for us all to be together as a family and share these experiences together, we just can’t.</p>
        <p>This was/ is a hard reality for me to come to terms with. But, this is our reality, this is our normal.</p>
        <p>In this Easter season, I cannot help to be reminded of new beginnings and renewed hope.  I must always try and look at the bright side and remember that my husband and I were given a remarkable gift of a special son for which we will always be grateful.</p>

        <h2>Unconditional Love</h2>
        <img src="images/love.png" width="578" height="229" alt="hugs">
        <h3>February 8, 2016 </h3>
        <p>February – It is hard not to think about Love this month.</p>
        <p>There are plenty of reminders if it might slip your mind.  My favorite?  The class lists that come home where my kids need to address all the Valentine’s.  With four children in school, it can be in upwards of 100 Valentine’s.  It’s fun times for about 10 Valentines until I tell them they each only have 25 more to do!</p>
        <p>But the idea is more than writing out seemingly endless Valentine’s.  It is an opportunity for me to reflect on the love I have for my family.</p>
        <p>My husband and I have four children; the oldest is our 11-year-old son Gavin, who, among other things, is non-verbal. I love Gavin and his brothers and sister with a kind of love I never knew existed.  A mother’s love for her children; the true meaning of unconditional love.</p>
        <p>I tell each of them every day that I love them and feel the joy in my own heart when they respond.</p>
        <p><span style="font-style:italic">But what about Gavin, my non-verbal, 11-year-old son?</span> I am always telling him how much he is loved, how much I love him – but he never responds like my other kids.</p>
        <p>What he does do is pretty incredible, though.</p>
        <p>Often, when I am sitting down Gavin will sit down on my lap and look me right in the eyes while bringing my head to his so our foreheads and noses touch.  I whisper I love you to him.</p>
        <p>Then he will pull his head away and intently look at me with the most beautiful green eyes surrounded by the longest lashes.</p>
        <p>It’s difficult to describe the intensity of his look. It’s as if we are talking with our minds and all the words he so desperately tried to have come out after all these years of silence just travel an invisible path from his head to mine.</p>
        <p>In these moments, I can feel Gavin’s unconditional love for me deep in my own heart as if he was shouting it out at the top of his lungs.</p>
        <p>But he doesn’t need to. He found a way to show me with a message that we both clearly understand.</p>
        <p>While there is not a lot with Gavin that is typical, sometimes it is that very uniqueness that makes life so beautiful.</p>
